This is a Flutter app created for my Tsoftek internship modelled after a Food Delivery app

This app features:
- Account log in/sign up
- Google Firebase for real time data storage / account authentication
- Custom Food classes, widgets, and pages
- Like buttons
- Pages for more information accessible by clicking any Food widget
- Filtering food by different tags


App can be run by cloning the repository and running it on an android emulator in AndroidStudio with the Flutter plugin installed.
